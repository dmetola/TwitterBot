# TwitterBot

The purpose of this bot is to automate the tedious task of retweeting and liking posts for the sake of networking. It is mainly focused on business accounts, so that they can devote more time to create contentful posts, but regular users can also benefit from it. For the bot to work, it is needed to have Twitter API credentials.

At this stage, the bot is in charge of retweeting and liking posts that meet the keywords introduced by the user in the code. It is still under development, and I intend to add more functionality to it.

Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!!
